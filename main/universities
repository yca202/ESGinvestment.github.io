    <h3>Commitment in policy to screen out fossil fuel investment</h3>
    <p>
      In 2020/2021 report findings consist of a 5% commitment in policy to
      screen out fossil fuel investments. Whereas, in 2022/2023 report there was
      seven-time increased commitment noted by the University of Exeter to
      screen out fossil fuel investments. This is a promising start towards the
      carbon net zero movement. As well as having a policy that is more reliant
      on renewable energy sources.

      suggest the Cardiff Metropolitan University scored full marks for
      screening out fossil fuel investments, investments in arms companies and
      border industry companies.

    <h3>Ethical banking policy</h3>
    <p>
      There seems to be no ethical banking policy mentioned on the University of
      Exeter's website, as shown in the 2020/2021
      <a
        href="https://peopleandplanet.org/university-league/2021/u192/university-of-exeter#section4"

        href="https://peopleandplanet.org/university-league/2022/u855/university-of-exeter#eib"
        >report</a
      >
      there has been no recorded improvement on the People and Planet website.
      This potentially shows a lack of awareness to create a policy regarding
      sustainable finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Cardiff Metropolitan university scored full marks for their
      ethical banking policy, due to the Ethical Investment Policy on their
      website with appropriate contact details.

    <h3>Commitment in policy to screen out arms companies</h3>
    <p>
      According to <a href="">University of Exeter's website</a> there seems to
      be no policy commiting to screen out investments in arms companies such as
      United States Air force (USAF), or border industry companies as the
      university has scored 0/10% and 0/5% respectively according to
      <a
        href="https://peopleandplanet.org/university-league/2022/u855/university-of-exeter#eib"
        >data</a

      other partners for an electromagnetic research project as

        data</a
      >
      has shown . This may be alarming and may be the reason for a lower score
      of 63% in the Ethical investment and banking sector
      <a
        href="https://peopleandplanet.org/university-league/2022/u855/university-of-exeter#eib"

      in 2022/2023. However, this is a higher score than

        >the previous year of 28% </a
      >in ethical investment and banking so the university may be actively
      proposing action plans to become more financially sustainable to the
      environment.

      Cardiff Metropolitan university actively
      <a href="https://ded1.co/universities/142/">does not accept any grants</a>
      from armed forces which may lend itself as to why it scored
